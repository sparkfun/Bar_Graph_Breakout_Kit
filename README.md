[*SparkFun Bar Graph Breakout Kit (DEV-10936)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10936)

This kit contains a PCB and all the parts needed to build a 30-LED bargraph that can be driven by an Arduino or other microcontroller.

This kit uses our 74HC595 shift registers and 10-Segment bargraph modules to create the display. We supply one green, one yellow, and one red module for ‘safe / caution / DANGER!’ displays. 
The display is easily driven by a microcontroller using an SSI interface, and you have individual control over every LED.
